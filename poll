Hi [Manager Name],

I have completed the investigation into the failure for the meeting submission titled “Internal Interview : testcatena JPJPSendCVFeb2026”.

Based on Azure container logs (UTC timestamp 19/02/2026 23:07), the payload was successfully built and the request was sent to the OneTouch endpoint. However, the request failed with a ReadTimeout exception. This indicates that the OneTouch API did not respond within the configured timeout window.

Current Findings:

The OneTouch client timeout is set to 10 seconds.

The request exceeded this limit and triggered a ReadTimeout.

The failure occurred after payload construction, confirming this is not a data or validation issue.

The issue appears to be related to external API latency rather than internal application logic.

Recommended Actions:

Increase the OneTouch API timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.
At this stage, the root cause is an external dependency timeout rather than an application defect.

Please let me know if you would like this implemented under a change request or further analysis performed.
