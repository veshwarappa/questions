The delay was caused by Microsoft Teams’ asynchronous transcript finalization process. After the meeting ended, Teams took approximately 55 minutes to process and make the transcript available via Microsoft Graph.

The actual meeting start and end time (09:58 AM – 10:00 AM Sydney time) was confirmed by Priyanka and validated using the Teams recording timeline. Recording stopped at 10:00 AM, and the transcript became available in our system at approximately 10:55–10:56 AM Sydney time.

Our system processed the transcript immediately once it became available and completed successfully without any delays or errors.

There were no internal bottlenecks or failures observed. The only time gap occurred between recording stop and transcript availability, confirming that the delay originated upstream within Microsoft Teams’ infrastructure.

Conclusion

The transcript delay was not caused by our pipeline.
It was due to Microsoft Teams’ transcript finalization latency, which is outside our system’s control.
