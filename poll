Hi [Manager Name],

I’ve completed the investigation into the issue where restriction notes were still appearing in OneTouch (OT) after being removed in the UI.

**Root Cause**

In the frontend payload builder, restriction notes are only included if the value is not `undefined`:

```typescript
if (options?.restrictionNotesOriginal !== undefined) {
  payload.restrictionNotesOriginal = options.restrictionNotesOriginal;
}
```

When a consultant removes restriction notes in the UI, the value becomes `undefined`. Because of the `!== undefined` check, the field is omitted from the payload entirely.

As a result:

* OT does not receive any instruction to clear the field.
* OT retains the existing restriction notes (or repopulates from source data).
* Our backend stores and submits the previous base64-encoded value again.

This explains why restriction notes continue to appear even after being removed.

**Proposed Fix**

Update the UI logic so that when restriction notes are cleared, the value is explicitly set to an empty string (`""`) instead of `undefined`.

This ensures:

* The field is included in the payload.
* OT receives an explicit instruction to clear the notes.
* The old value is not re-used or persisted.

I will proceed with implementing and testing this change unless you would like to review further.

If you'd like, I can also draft a shorter executive summary version.
