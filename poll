The delay was caused by Microsoft Teams’ asynchronous transcript finalization process. After the meeting ended, Teams took approximately 55 minutes to process and make the transcript available via Microsoft Graph.

Our system began processing immediately once the transcript became available and completed successfully without any delays or errors.

There were no internal bottlenecks or failures. The only time gap occurred between recording stop and transcript availability, confirming the delay originated upstream on Microsoft Teams’ infrastructure.

Conclusion

The transcript delay was not caused by our pipeline.
It was due to Microsoft Teams’ transcript finalization latency, which is outside our system’s control.
