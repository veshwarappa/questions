To mitigate this issue, I recommend increasing the OneTouch client timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds to better accommodate potential latency from the 
external API and monitoring the behavior after deployment. If similar timeouts continue, we can implement limited retry logic (2–3 attempts with exponential 
backoff) to handle transient failures more gracefully. This approach should reduce user-facing failures while maintaining system stability.

Based on the above analysis, the incident was caused by an external OneTouch API timeout rather than an internal application defect. 
I recommend increasing the configured timeout and monitoring for recurrence, with retry logic to be considered if similar transient failures continue. 
Please let me know if you would like any additional details included or if further investigation is required.
