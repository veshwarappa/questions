The Problem
The !== undefined check means: if the value is undefined, the field is completely omitted from the payload.
When a consultant "removes" restriction notes in the UI, the value likely becomes undefined. So:
The field gets excluded from the payload entirely
OT never receives an instruction to clear the notes
OT then falls back to the source/original data which still has the notes → they appear in OT
This explains both scenarios:
No existing notes in OT → OT creates from source data, which still has the notes (bug)
Existing notes in OT → OT keeps what it already has, which may already be correct

fix it at the UI/component level — when the user removes notes, set the value to "" (empty string) instead of undefined, 
so it passes the existing check and sends the empty value to OT.
