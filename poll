Microsoft Teams generates transcripts asynchronously after a meeting ends. Once recording stops, Teams performs backend processing that includes audio ingestion, 
speech-to-text conversion, transcript formatting, storage, and publishing through Microsoft Graph APIs. 
The transcript is not accessible to external systems until this internal processing is fully completed. 
The duration of this process can vary depending on factors such as Microsoft service load, regional processing queues, recording size, 
and backend resource allocation.

The transcript delay was not caused by our pipeline. 
It was due to Microsoft Teams’ upstream transcript finalization latency, which occurs within Microsoft’s infrastructure and is outside our system’s control.
